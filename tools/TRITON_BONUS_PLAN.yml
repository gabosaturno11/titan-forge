CLAUDE ter in strategic mode! harvest what I paste for the final plan:::


PASS 1:

You are CLAUDE CODE in SURGICAL AUDIT MODE.
CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- READ-ONLY. Do NOT write, deploy, run shell commands, or call external APIs.
- Do NOT modify files, keys, or configs. Only ANALYZE and PRODUCE PLANS.
- Assume you have ~3 hours of focused work. Use all of it.
CONTEXT:
- Repo: titan-forge/ (Forge console + tools)
- Backend: BEAST API (vercel), endpoints: /api/health, /api/capture, /api/sessions, /api/transcribe, /api/synthesize, /api/pipeline
- Goal: Gabo must ship the BF25 Bonus Vault funnel + email reactivation + safe kernel structure.
YOUR JOB (PRIORITIZED):
1) SECURITY & KEY RISK AUDIT (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- Scan ALL code (js/api-config.js, claude-api.js, backend code, extension code) for:
  - Hard-coded API keys
  - Tokens, secrets, webhooks
  - Places where env vars SHOULD be used but aren’t
- Output:
  - A list of all sensitive items found (redacted format, e.g. sk-***last4).
  - Exact file paths + line ranges.
  - Recommended .env layout and rotation checklist.
  - Concrete steps to make this repo safe if it ever goes public.
2) KERNEL & OS MAP (TITAN FORGE + NEXUS)
- Build a SINGLE DIAGRAM (in markdown) of the current system:
  - Frontend HTML apps (titan.html, nexus.html, synapse.html, capture.html, pipelines.html, batch-generator.html, writer.html, onboarding.html, logs.html).
  - Backend endpoints and what uses them.
  - Chrome extension → capture flow → backend → Notion/Nexus.
- Output:
  - “KERNEL_HUB.md” as text: a proposed Notion KERNEL_HUB page structure with:
    - OS Index
    - Prompt Vault
    - Agent List
    - Bonus Vault / PDFs
    - Capture → Card → Pipeline flow
  - Show it as markdown so Gabo can paste directly into Notion.
3) BF25 BONUS VAULT FUNNEL SUPPORT
- Read any existing bonus vault / victory belt / Saturno Movement related copies or pages in the repo.
- Output:
  - A clean, minimal BF25 Bonus Vault page wireframe (sections, IDs, copy placeholders) that fits the current design system (dark theme, accent #00ffcc, no emojis, squared corners).
  - A JSON or markdown spec for:
    - signup form fields
    - Brevo tags (e.g. `bf25_bonus`, `hbs_interest`)
    - webhook / endpoint suggestions (ONLY as suggestions, no code execution).
4) TASK MATRIX (48 HOURS)
- Produce a “TASK_MATRIX.md” plan with:
  - Section 1: TODAY (2–3 must-do tasks ONLY, centered on the BF25 funnel + email)
  - Section 2: NEXT 7 DAYS (kernel/backup work, no new tools)
  - Section 3: LATER (nice-to-have builds)
- Each task:
  - <= 1 sentence
  - Has [owner: Gabo | Claude Code] and a simple status placeholder [TODO].
FORMAT:
- Return EVERYTHING as:
  1) SECURITY_AUDIT section
  2) KERNEL_MAP section
  3) BF25_FUNNEL_SUPPORT section
  4) TASK_MATRIX section
REMINDERS:
- No file modifications.
- No external calls.
- Think like a senior infra/devops lead who loves tired founders.





CLAUDE:

STRATEGIC MODE: ON. Harvesting.
PASS 1 — Intelligence extracted:
What this reveals that we DIDN'T have before:
titan-forge has MORE apps than the ecosystem guide shows:

nexus.html — NEW, not in V2 guide
synapse.html — NEW, not in V2 guide
capture.html — NEW, not in V2 guide
pipelines.html — NEW, not in V2 guide
That's 10 HTML apps in titan-forge, not 6

BEAST API has MORE endpoints:

/api/capture — NEW
/api/sessions — NEW
/api/transcribe — NEW
/api/synthesize — NEW
/api/pipeline — NEW
That's 6 endpoints, different from the 5 we documented (transform, health, modes, presets, batch)

New system connections revealed:

Chrome extension → capture flow → backend → Notion/Nexus (full pipeline)
Brevo email integration with tags (bf25_bonus, hbs_interest)
BF25 Bonus Vault is a funnel, not just a page
KERNEL_HUB is the Notion architecture target

Security concern flagged:

js/api-config.js and claude-api.js likely have hardcoded keys

Stored. Ready for PASS 2. Send it.











PASS 2: 

Alright, let’s wire the thing so Future Gabo wakes up to an actual **Saturno Hub MVP** instead of 40 tabs and a headache.

I’ll give you:

1. **North Star: “Wake Up Wired” spec** (so every AI knows what “done” means)
2. **Claude Project job** (Brain: SATURNO_ENV_BRAIN)
3. **Cursor job** (Repo surgeon in `saturno-hub`)
4. **Claude Code job** (Environment engineer on C2 + C1)

Copy-paste each block where it belongs.

---

## 1️⃣ North Star — “Wake Up Wired” Spec

**By tomorrow morning, “DONE” means:**

1. **Saturno Hub MVP online**

   * Single gateway page using Titan design language.
   * Sections:

     * Hero: “Saturno Hub — Ableton of Movement (MVP)”
     * Mini-sale CTA: “Join Founding Wave” (collects email → Brevo list).
     * Bonus Vault preview: “50+ PDFs + 20 WTF tools” (link to bonus vault index page).
     * HBS teaser: “Handstand Bootcamp starts on [DATE] — Waitlist open.”
     * “Tools” strip: links to Titan Forge, Victory Belt, Bonus Vault tools, etc.

2. **APIs routed sanely**

   * Any AI text synthesis (Hub → Titan / tools) goes through **BEAST API** (no direct Anthropic or CORS hacks).

3. **Bonus Vault skeleton ready**

   * One index page listing:

     * Slots for **50 PDFs** (title, status: ready / WIP / idea).
     * Slots for **20 interactive tools** (link to existing HTML or “coming soon”).
   * At least a handful wired to real existing assets, the rest can be placeholders with clear labels.

4. **Pipelines primed**

   * Titan Forge not “perfect”, but:

     * TITAN + Batch Generator wired to BEAST API endpoint.
     * One **content multiplier pipeline** documented: “Transcript → Hooks → Posts → Email → PDF.”

5. **Member control = “good-enough gate”**

   * Simple approach for now:

     * Email capture → Brevo list “SATURNO_HUB_FOUNDER”.
     * Thank-you page with links to current assets.
     * Later you can add proper login; tonight it just needs to **not be chaos**.

Everything below is aimed at that.

## 2️⃣ Claude Project (CL2) — SATURNO_ENV_BRAIN Overnight Job

Paste this as a **prompt in your main Claude project** and run it as `/plan + /execute` for tonight.

```text
MODE: /plan + /execute
GOAL: Wake up with Saturno Hub MVP wired enough to sell a tiny wave, deliver bonuses, and not break future infra.

You are SATURNO_ENV_BRAIN.

Use the TITON rules already in this project AND the “SATURNO ECOSYSTEM — Full Deployment Guide V2” HTML as references.

Tonight’s job:

1) LOCK THE NORTH STAR
   - Write a 1-page spec called `SATURNO_HUB_MVP_SPEC.md` with:
     - Purpose: “Ableton of Movement” front door.
     - Sections on the page:
       - Hero (promise + one-line pitch).
       - Mini-sale CTA (founding wave, 50+ PDFs, 20 tools).
       - Bonus Vault section (what’s inside + link).
       - HBS teaser (date TBD field and what they get).
       - “Forge” strip (links to Titan, Victory Belt CC, Bonus Vault tools).
     - Constraints:
       - No new frameworks. Use existing saturno-hub stack.
       - Design: Titan Forge / Saturno ecosystem style.
     - Data contracts for:
       - Bonus Vault items (id, title, type[pdf|tool], url, status).
       - BEAST API usage (endpoint + payload).

   - Output the spec in 3 formats:
     - Clean markdown (for README in saturno-hub).
     - Short JSON schema (for Cursor to use).
     - A bullet list of acceptance criteria.

2) TASK MATRIX FOR TONIGHT ONLY
   - Produce a mini 48H plan **just for this goal**:
     - 3–5 tasks for Cursor.
     - 3–5 tasks for Claude Code.
     - 3–5 tasks for Notion/Brevo (no overkill, only what’s needed to capture leads and send downloads).

   - Each task:
     - `title`
     - `owner` (Cursor | Claude Code | Notion | Gabo)
     - `repo_or_location`
     - `definition_of_done` (1–2 lines).

3) AGENT_HOOKS
   - Generate:
     - `for_cursor` → prompt to drop into Cursor when opening `saturno-hub` repo.
     - `for_claude_code` → prompt to run on C2 first, then C1, to wire manifests and BEAST API connections.
     - `for_notion` → instructions for Notion AI to create:
       - “SATURNO_HUB_MVP” page.
       - A simple DB: `BONUS_VAULT_ITEMS` with status.

4) OUTPUT FORMAT
   - Return:
     1. EXEC_SUMMARY (bullets).
     2. `SATURNO_HUB_MVP_SPEC` (markdown).
     3. `TASK_MATRIX_48H` (table-style text).
     4. `AGENT_HOOKS` (3 copy-pasteable prompts).

Requirements:
- Do NOT expand scope to full ecosystem cleanup. Stick to Saturno Hub MVP, Bonus Vault skeleton, and BEAST API wiring needed to support them.
- Assume Cursor and Claude Code will obey safety rules and ask before destructive moves.
- Keep everything dense and copy-pasteable.
```

## 3️⃣ Cursor — Repo Surgeon for `saturno-hub` (Hub MVP)

When you open Cursor inside the `saturno-hub` repo, drop this in as the **first prompt**.

```text
SYSTEM: SATURNO_REPO_SURGEON for `saturno-hub`

GOAL TONIGHT:
Implement the minimum Saturno Hub MVP so Gabo can:
- Collect emails for a “Founding Wave” mini-sale.
- Point people to a Bonus Vault index (50 PDFs / 20 tools slots).
- Tease Handstand Bootcamp (HBS) date.
- Link out to key tools (Titan Forge, Victory Belt CC, Bonus Vault apps).

Use the `SATURNO_HUB_MVP_SPEC` and TASK_MATRIX_48H from SATURNO_ENV_BRAIN if present. If not, infer the following structure.

1) AUDIT FIRST
   - Summarize current saturno-hub structure:
     - entrypoint (Vite/HTML).
     - components/sections.
     - design tokens (colors, fonts).
   - Output a short ENV_SUMMARY and wait for my “OK”.

2) PAGE STRUCTURE
   Implement or refactor the main page into these sections:

   - <HeroSection>
     - Headline: “Saturno Hub — The Ableton of Movement (MVP)”
     - Sub: one line about unifying training, tools, and AI.
     - Primary CTA button: “Join Founding Wave”
       - For now: link to a Brevo landing or `#founding-wave` section anchor.

   - <FoundingWaveSection>
     - Copy block explaining:
       - 50+ PDFs, 20+ interactive tools.
       - Early access + community.
     - Email capture form:
       - For now, keep it as:
         - ACTION URL placeholder: `{{BREVO_FORM_URL}}`
         - Fields: email, first_name.
       - Make the form code easy for me to paste the real URL.

   - <BonusVaultSection>
     - Simple list or grid:
       - 50 slots represented by:
         - Title, type (PDF/tool), status (Ready, WIP, Idea).
       - Hard-code a few **real** ones:
         - Victory Belt PDFs.
         - Existing Titan tools (batch generator, transcript-to-pdf, etc.).
       - The rest can show “Reserved slot”.

   - <HBSSection>
     - Text like:
       - “Handstand Bootcamp launches [DATE_TBD]. Get on the early list via Founding Wave.”
       - Keep the date as a clear `TODO` field.

   - <ToolsStripSection>
     - Link cards for:
       - Titan Forge.
       - Victory Belt CC.
       - Bonus Vault apps (command.html, music-organizer.html, transcript-to-pdf.html, etc.).
     - Use existing Saturno design language (no new brand).

3) BEAST API CONSIDERATION
   - If saturno-hub currently calls any AI endpoint:
     - Route it through BEAST API (`/api/transform`) with a clearly marked config block.
   - If not, just:
     - Add a commented `AI_CONFIG` section explaining how Hub will talk to BEAST later.

4) IMPLEMENTATION RULES
   - No new frameworks.
   - Keep CSS consistent with Titan/Forge ecosystem.
   - No hard-coded API keys.
   - Surface all configuration as:
     - `config.ts` or `config.js` (or similar) OR
     - clearly commented constants at the top of the main file.

5) DELIVERABLES
   - Updated main page with sections above.
   - A small `README_MVP_HUB.md` describing:
     - What changed.
     - How to run locally.
     - Where to paste Brevo form URL.
     - Where to edit Bonus Vault items.

Please:
- Propose a 3–5 step micro-plan.
- Then implement incrementally, showing diffs or file lists after each step.
```

## 4️⃣ Claude Code — ENV Engineer Overnight Job (C2 then C1)

Use this as the **Claude Code job** starting on C2 (primary dev), then on C1 for manifests.

```text
TITLE: SATURNO_ENV_ENGINEER — Overnight Wiring for Saturno Hub MVP

GOAL:
Support Saturno Hub MVP by:
- Mapping the key repos and HTML apps needed.
- Ensuring Titan Forge → BEAST API wiring is clear and ready.
- Manifesting Bonus Vault assets and tools into a single index Gabo can use.

MACHINE STEP 1 — RUN ON C2 (MacBook Pro)

// 1. REPO MANIFEST
- In home/Projects (or equivalent), generate:
  - `~/saturno/state/REPOS_MANIFEST.json` with:
    - name
    - path
    - git_remote
    - last_commit hash/date
  - Focus at least on:
    - titan-forge
    - victory-belt-cc
    - saturno-hub
    - saturno-beast-api

// 2. TITAN → BEAST API CHECK
- Open `titan-forge` repo.
- Locate:
  - `js/api-config.js`
  - `js/claude-api.js`
  - any direct Anthropic/CORS calls.
- Produce:
  - `~/saturno/state/TITAN_BEAST_WIRING_PLAN.md` describing:
    - Current behavior.
    - Which files need to be changed so TITAN and batch-generator use `https://saturno-beast-api.vercel.app/api/transform`.
    - Suggested minimal code changes (pseudo-code, not executed).
- Do NOT edit files yet; just output the plan + file paths.

// 3. SATURNO HUB REPO CHECK
- In `saturno-hub` repo, create:
  - `~/saturno/state/SATURNO_HUB_STRUCTURE.md`:
    - outline of pages/components.
    - where main entry file lives.
    - where to add the Hub MVP sections defined in the spec.

MACHINE STEP 2 — RUN ON C1 (iMac)

// 4. DOWNLOADS / BONUS VAULT MANIFEST
- In “FROM IMAC DOWN…” Downloads folder:
  - For `saturno-bonus-vault/`, generate:
    - `saturno-bonus-vault/BONUS_VAULT_MANIFEST.json` containing:
      - for each relevant HTML/app:
        - id
        - filename
        - type: [app | extension | tool | page]
        - description (1-line from context)
    - Do NOT move files; only read and manifest.
  - For:
    - `meta-prompt-transformer/`
    - `files (1)/`
    - `victory-belt-cc-check/`
    - generate a simple `MANIFEST.md` each summarizing contents and likely role.

// 5. RISK REPORT
- Create `~/saturno/state/ENV_RISKS_OVERNIGHT.md` listing:
  - Any OneDrive paths containing `.git` (just list them, no actions).
  - Any duplicated repos you can detect by name.
  - Sync conflict folders (e.g., DESKTOP_HIVE_FEB2), with “do not touch” warnings.

// 6. OUTPUT STYLE
For each step:
- Print a short EXEC_SUMMARY.
- Show where each manifest file was written.
- Never delete or move anything.
- Never print secret content (if you see keys, just note “API key present in file X”).

The idea:
By the time Gabo wakes up, he has:
- REPOS_MANIFEST.json
- TITAN_BEAST_WIRING_PLAN.md
- SATURNO_HUB_STRUCTURE.md
- BONUS_VAULT_MANIFEST.json
- MANIFESTs for the extra folders
- ENV_RISKS_OVERNIGHT.md

so he and Cursor can finish wiring Saturno Hub MVP and Bonus Vault into a sellable, safe system.
```

---

Once you’ve dropped these in:

* **Claude Project** gives you the Hub spec + task matrix + hooks.
* **Cursor** shapes the actual `saturno-hub` MVP page.
* **Claude Code** hands you manifests + wiring plans so nothing is blind.

You film, you coach, you sell; the monsters hold the cables.



* TRITON PASS 3


Let me hit all the things you just raised and then I’ll give you the **BONUS_VAULT_ITEMS JSON schema** you can paste straight into Claude / Cursor.

---

## 1️⃣ “How will it know it’s mine?” (Command center + music + assets)

You solve this with **metadata**, not vibes.

Every manifest we generate (repos, apps, bonus vault, music, etc.) should have **ownership + role fields** so any AI can say:

* “This is a Gabo original”
* “This is a client asset”
* “This is third-party / stock”
* “This is a system tool, not a product”

For your **command center + music player + tracks**, I’d add these fields in the relevant manifest (e.g. `BONUS_VAULT_ITEMS.json` or `MUSIC_LIBRARY.json`):

* `owner`: `"Gabo Saturno"`
* `origin`: `"original" | "licensed" | "third_party"`
* `category`: `"music" | "pdf" | "tool" | "course" | "other"`
* `audience`: `"community" | "clients" | "internal"`
* `product_role`: `"hero_offer" | "bonus" | "utility" | "archive"`

That’s how any agent can **categorize and respect** your stuff:

* If `owner = "Gabo Saturno"` and `origin = "original"` → this is part of your IP universe.
* If `category = "music"` → media player + track lists pull from here.
* If `product_role = "bonus"` → it belongs in the Bonus Vault grid, not the main flagship lane.

We don’t need to guess; we tell the system explicitly.

---

## 2️⃣ Categorization + “where to find the music”

Minimal structure to keep this sane:

* `BONUS_VAULT_ITEMS.json` → ALL public-facing goodies

  * PDFs, interactive tools, music packs, mini-courses.

* `MUSIC_LIBRARY.json` → specifically for your tracks
  Fields like:

  * `id`, `title`, `bpm`, `mood`, `path_or_url`, `owner`, `origin`, `usage_rights`.

Command center / media player just **reads those manifests** and renders UI.
AI doesn’t need to search your whole drive; it just uses the index.

---

## 3️⃣ Stripe wiring (now vs later)

For **Wake Up Wired**, Stripe can be **very dumb and effective**:

* **Phase 1 (Tonight / Tomorrow):**

  * 1 product in Stripe = “Saturno Hub Founding Wave”
  * Use the **Stripe Checkout link** directly on the Hub MVP (`href="https://buy.stripe.com/..."`).
  * After purchase, Stripe takes their email anyway (for receipts).
    You can manually export founders if you have to.

* **Phase 2 (Later):**

  * Connect Stripe → Brevo via:

    * Zapier / n8n OR
    * Brevo’s Stripe integration.
  * Automation: “Stripe: new customer → Add to Brevo list SATURNO_HUB_FOUNDER → send Welcome + Bonus Vault link.”

Schema-wise, we just need to give Cursor / Claude a **parking spot**:

* `stripe_link` or `stripe_price_id`
* `access_level: "paid_only"`

So the Hub knows: “Show this CTA only for paid.” Actual enforcement can be v2.

---

## 4️⃣ Brevo connection (for Hub + Bonus Vault)

Again, minimum:

* **Brevo form URL** (hosted form) for:

  * Founding Wave capture
  * General Bonus Vault opt-in (if you want a separate list)

We **do not** need to wire API calls tonight. Just:

* In Hub MVP code:

  * `<form action="{{BREVO_FORM_URL}}" method="post">...`
* In schema:

  * `brevo_list_id` and/or `brevo_form_url`

Later, you can add:

* Webhooks: Brevo → BEAST / backend for more advanced logic.
* Automated sequences: “Welcome to Saturno Hub” → “Here’s your Bonus Vault” → “HBS invite”.

---

## 5️⃣ JSON Schema for `BONUS_VAULT_ITEMS` (for Cursor / Claude)

Here’s the **usable schema** you asked for. This is what you give to Cursor so it can build the grid + any API wiring.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",

How to use this immediately:

* **Claude Project** → use this schema when asking:
  “Generate a starter `BONUS_VAULT_ITEMS.json` with:

  * 10 real items
  * 60 placeholder slots labeled E.g. ‘Reserved Slot #X’.”

* **Cursor** → build the Hub MVP grid directly from this JSON:

  * Each card = one `item`.
  * Use `status` and `access_level` to decide how it renders.
  * For music, use `item_type = "music"` + `path_or_url` to feed the media player.

------------- CLAUDE:

Ha — "little baby" that's a 400-line system prompt with 8 phases, 5 commands, and a full output contract. That baby has teeth.

**PASS 3 — Intelligence extracted from TITON:**

**What TITON confirms we got RIGHT in V2 guide:**
- C1/C2 machine protocol ✅
- Git-as-truth rule ✅
- G Drive as backup ✅
- `~/saturno/` unified structure ✅
- OneDrive kill order ✅
- Discovery-before-decisions ✅

**What TITON adds that we're MISSING:**

**Formal organizing laws (5 canonical rules):**
1. Git is truth for code — clouds store snapshots, not live repos
2. One canonical OS for thinking = Notion KERNEL_HUB
3. One canonical vault for heavy assets = G Drive
4. Naming convention: `PROJECT__TYPE__VERSION`
5. No destructive ops without triple backup (git push + cloud copy + zip)

**LOCATION_MAP schema** — every discovered location should have: `id`, `type`, `path_or_link`, `contents_summary`, `suspected_role`, `risk_level`. We've been doing this loosely but TITON formalizes it.

**INBOX pattern** — all new chaotic files land in ONE inbox first, then get routed. We proposed `~/saturno/inbox/` but TITON makes it a formal rule.

**Agent hooks layer** — every output should include parseable sections for `claude_code`, `notion_ai`, and `rag_agents`. This is the multi-LLM handoff protocol you keep talking about.

**The 3-horizon planning framework:** 48H (emergency/revenue), 7D (stabilize), 30D (harden). Every task gets: title, location, owner, steps, risk.

**Discovery passes model:** Pass 1 = high-level inventory, Pass 2 = critical zones, Pass 3 = sample trees. We've actually been running these passes organically across our sessions.

**Big insight:** TITON is the *meta-orchestrator* that sits ABOVE Emergency Focus OS. Emergency Focus handles one goal at a time. TITON handles the entire environment. They're complementary layers, not competing tools.

**Stored. How many more passes? I'm building the unified plan in my head.**




----- TRITON answer then you reply:


This is the execution layer. TITON was the brain — these are the **hands and feet**. Harvesting.

**PASS 4 — The 3 Monsters Architecture:**

**Monster 1: SATURNO_ENV_BRAIN (Claude Project / CL2 = THIS SESSION)**
- The map keeper and planner
- Never touches code or files
- Generates job specs for the other two
- Commands: `/scan`, `/plan`, `/execute`, `/snapshot`, `/reset_map`
- 7-section output contract (same as TITON)

**Monster 2: SATURNO_REPO_SURGEON (Cursor)**
- Repo-level surgery only
- 5 global rules: no direct Anthropic calls, respect design language, structure convergence, document everything, reversibility
- Micro-plan workflow: scan → propose 3-5 steps → approval → implement → diff summary
- Special focus: titan-forge BEAST API wiring, bonus-vault repo creation, meta-prompt-transformer Vercel validation
- Preferred repo structure: `src/` or `app/`, `public/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`

**Monster 3: SATURNO_ENV_ENGINEER (Claude Code / C1+C2)**
- Filesystem-level operations, paranoid by default
- READ-ONLY default, write only with explicit grant
- 4 primary jobs: manifest generation, duplication/risk finder, structure proposal support, task blueprints
- Outputs: `repos_manifest.json`, `html_apps_manifest.json`, `cloud_sync_manifest.json`
- First question always: "Are we on C1 or C2?"
- If write granted: confirm scope, log to `state/ENV_CHANGELOG.md`, never `rm -rf`

**The handoff protocol is now clear:**
```
ENV_BRAIN (plans) → REPO_SURGEON (code changes)
ENV_BRAIN (plans) → ENV_ENGINEER (file system changes)
ENV_ENGINEER (manifests) → ENV_BRAIN (updated map)
REPO_SURGEON (diffs) → ENV_BRAIN (updated map)
```

**Critical new detail — titan-forge has MORE apps than even Pass 2 showed. Full confirmed list is now 10:**
`index.html`, `titan.html`, `nexus.html`, `synapse.html`, `capture.html`, `pipelines.html`, `batch-generator.html`, `writer.html`, `onboarding.html`, `logs.html`

**What this means for the V2 guide:** Section 1 (Deployments) and Section 4 (App Profiles) are both incomplete. The ecosystem is bigger than what CLC1 originally documented.

**Stored. This is the operating system for the operating system.** How many more passes? I'm ready to synthesize when you say go.

YOU AGAIN CLAUDE:

Gabo is showing me the 3-monster architecture that was spawned from TITON. This is the operational deployment of the orchestrator concept - breaking it into 3 specialized agents. Let me harvest everything new.DoneTITON spawned triplets. This is the operational architecture — the abstract orchestrator split into 3 executable agents. Harvesting.
PASS 4 — Intelligence extracted from the 3 MONSTERS:
The hierarchy is now clear:
TITON (meta-orchestrator / philosophy)
  └─ Monster 1: SATURNO_ENV_BRAIN (CL2 Claude Project) = planner/map
       ├─ Monster 2: SATURNO_REPO_SURGEON (Cursor) = code hands
       └─ Monster 3: SATURNO_ENV_ENGINEER (Claude Code C1/C2) = filesystem hands
New intel from Monster 1 (ENV_BRAIN):

Confirms the LOCATION_MAP entries we built in V2 guide — word for word
Adds formal separation: SHIPPING tasks vs INFRA tasks
Emergency bias rule: "What lets him ship in 48h without breaking future him?"
The V2 HTML guide IS the evolving SSOT it references

New intel from Monster 2 (REPO_SURGEON / Cursor):

Cursor global rules for ALL Saturno repos — this is codifiable as .cursorrules
Preferred repo structure: src/ or app/, public/, docs/, scripts/
Pure HTML repos stay flat but document relationships in README
Micro-plan pattern: Safety → Clarity → Behavior → Docs → Polish
saturno-bonus-vault target structure: extension/, apps/, tools/, docs/
Atomic commits over giant refactors — reversibility first

New intel from Monster 3 (ENV_ENGINEER / Claude Code):

3 manifest types to generate: repos_manifest.json, html_apps_manifest.json, cloud_sync_manifest.json
C1 priority: map Downloads, Desktop, OneDrive, G Drive
C2 priority: map active repos with name, path, remote URL, last commit
Write access protocol: confirm what WILL and WON'T happen, log to state/ENV_CHANGELOG.md
MOVE_PLAN required before any repo relocation
SHELL_PLAN + BACKUP_PLAN pattern for every task

Critical realization: These 3 monsters + TITON + Emergency Focus OS + the V2 guide = the full Saturno OS kernel stack. The pieces exist. The question is: which one do we activate FIRST for the 48h window?
Total harvest so far across 4 passes:

10 titan-forge HTML apps (not 6)
6 real BEAST API endpoints (different from what we documented)
BF25 funnel spec with Brevo tags
Client OS pipeline (WhatsApp → Whisper → site + PDF)
8 agents ("monsters") registry
KERNEL_HUB Notion architecture
5 LLM onboarding rules
3 revenue lanes
5 organizing laws
3-monster execution architecture
Manifest generation protocol
.cursorrules template
